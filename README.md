# CPP_Language_Decipher
The program uses text from different languages to figure out the language of the user's input.

The program analyzes the same piece of text in different languages. The frequency of different letters is recorded in the program. It gives the user 5 options. First, to see the letter count in each language. Second, to see the frequency of letters in order by language. Third, to take user input and analyze and display the frquency of the letters in that input. Fourth, to do everything that option 3 does but also display which language it is written in. Lastly, an option to exit the program. Option 4 will only work if a significant amount of text to analyze is provided.
